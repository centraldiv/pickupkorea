      <p class="mb-4">
        We reserve the right to modify, change, or update services, processes,
        and fees at any time upon notification of any relevant changes. The
        section below describes the delivery of services, our responsibilities,
        and your responsibilities related to using the services provided by
        Pickup Korea.
      </p>

      <div class="ml-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2.1 Warehouse Service</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Our core service is to store your shopping items at the address we
          provide and deliver them to your requested address. You may shop
          through our purchase service and, if you do not purchase through us,
          you will be required to provide us with information about the items
          you purchase. We are not responsible in any case for the discrepancy
          between the items you ordered and the items you received and the items
          we did not receive. No action can be taken if the items are lost
          during shipping to our facility, and please contact the retailer,
          sender, or carrier for any related issues. For packages that have
          passed 2 weeks since the user cannot be verified, Pickup Korea can
          dispose of them arbitrarily.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2.2 Purchase Service</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Pickup Korea may purchase products on your behalf. However, we will
          not purchase the product until you pay for the product and fees.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          After you make the payment, we will request the difference payment if
          we find out during the order that the price of the goods in the online
          store has been changed. Please understand that any change in the price
          of the goods is entirely up to the seller. To minimize the possibility
          of such a situation, please pay the price of your order as soon as
          possible, and you should inform Pickup Korea exactly of the
          precautions regarding the order.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cancellation requests will only be accepted before the seller ships
          the order.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If it has already been shipped, we need to process the return after
          the product has arrived at our address. Returns are not applicable to
          all situations, and returns are difficult, especially for custom-made
          products. Also, returns in Korea must usually be made within 7 days of
          receiving the product. Please note that fees may be deducted from the
          refundable amount when processing a refund. If it turns out to be a
          defective or incorrect product, please contact us and we will take
          appropriate action to resolve the issue. Otherwise, the following fees
          may be incurred for returns that occur:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>Cancellation fee 10,000 KRW</li>
          <li>
            Return fee 5,000 KRW if found to be defective or wrong product
          </li>
          <li>Return fee 20,000 KRW otherwise incurred</li>
          <li>
            Domestic round-trip shipping cost (corresponding to the seller's
            standard)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Additionally, even if cancellation or return occurs, the purchase
          service fee will not be refunded, and the difference excluding the fee
          will be credited as credit that can be used later.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2.3 Other Services</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Pickup Korea provides services such as unboxing service to check the
          condition of the items you purchased in the package and inclusion only
          service to reduce weight and volume by removing unnecessary items
          within the storage period of the packages. Inclusion only service is
          mainly for K-pop albums. Usually, items excluding CDs, lyric books,
          and packaging materials are selected to reduce the volume, and if the
          items you want to leave are different, you must let us know when
          ordering the service. Pickup Korea is not responsible for the disposal
          of items that have occurred without your notification.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">
          2.4 Consolidation, Delivery and Pickup Services
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Pickup Korea saves you on shipping costs by consolidating all the
          contents of your selected package into one box. Typically, all
          supplementary information, including slips and additional packaging,
          is removed. After repacking or consolidation is complete, additional
          repacking requests will be rejected as the box will be delivered to
          the loading area and no further requests can be made. The
          consolidation and repackaging process takes 2-3 business days.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Delivery will be made after payment of all shipping and other service
          costs. We offer a variety of express and standard delivery options,
          but we reserve the right to add, change or remove available courier
          services at any time.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If you have plans to visit Korea, you can also pick up the delivered
          items in person. Pick up by others is prohibited, and you can visit
          the Pickup Korea office with advance notice 7 days prior to the visit
          date by bringing an ID card to prove your identity. It is not possible
          to pick up items without prior reservation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2.5 Prohibited Items</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Your package may be discarded or returned due to containing prohibited
          items. This may result in additional fees such as return shipping
          costs, split service fees for repackaging and redelivery. We are not
          responsible for any delivery delays or costs incurred or incurred due
          to the inclusion of restricted or prohibited items. However, we will
          notify you if we identify restricted and/or potentially prohibited
          items. This includes but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
          <li>Artwork, antiques, precious metals</li>
          <li>
            Valuable documents such as currency, coins, debit cards, credit
            cards, SIM cards, securities, passports, etc.
          </li>
          <li>Perishable products</li>
          <li>Fragile products</li>
          <li>Plants</li>
          <li>Dangerous goods (chemicals, paint, batteries, perfume, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          *Under certain conditions, some dangerous goods may be shipped in
          limited quantities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Depending on your destination, certain food items may be restricted.
          These prohibited items may be disposed of at your local customs office
          and disposal fees may apply. Recipients are advised to consult with
          their local customs office before receiving the parcel.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2.6 Delivery Failure</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If the package cannot be delivered for any reason (incorrect address,
          non-delivery, customs clearance failure, etc.), the package will be
          returned to the sender's address or disposed of at the carrier's local
          facility, depending on the carrier's policy. We will contact you when
          notified by the carrier, but please note that we cannot be held
          responsible for packages that are discarded or returned if reasonable
          action is not taken in a timely manner or within the deadline
          specified by the local carrier.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In the event of a return, the shipping and service fees already paid
          do not include the costs incurred due to the return. Returns will be
          processed if you pay other costs (shipping fees, taxes, and other
          service charges) associated with the return.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To prevent such situations from occurring, we strongly recommend that
          you regularly monitor your parcels through the courier company's
          tracking system and conduct due diligence by resolving any issues that
          may arise in a timely manner.
